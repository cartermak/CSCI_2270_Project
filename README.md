Carter Mak and William Walker

### Basic Functions
- Inventory spare parts
- Identify things in the inventory
  - Sort by machine/type/whatever/part number
  - Search by all of the above
- Simple command line interface

### Shit to maybe use
- Ultralight UI for integrating HTML UI with C++

### Misc notes
- Emphasize that our application is relatively small-scale but is constructed in a way that would perform well with larger data sets
